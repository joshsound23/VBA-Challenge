Excel VBA Challenge

Background
  I was assigned to create a VBA script that loops through stocks for one year and records the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and the total volume. In addition I was assigned to apply conditional formatting to highlight positive change (green) and negative change (red). Included in this repo is a text file showcasing my VBA script and screenshots of the spreadsheet data and outcomes on Excel.
