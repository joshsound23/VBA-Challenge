Excel VBA Challenge

Background
  I was assigned to create a VBA script that loops through stocks for one year and records the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and the total volume. In addition I was assigned to apply conditional formatting to highlight positive change (green) and negative change (red). Included in this repo is a text file showcasing my VBA script and screenshots of the spreadsheet data and outcomes on Excel.

  Code Source
    In my script, the code that defined the last row of the worksheet ( last_row = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row ) was code I found from Stack Overflow. Also the format for much of my script stemmed from my TA (Erin) and his example problem.
